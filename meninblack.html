Alleged government agents trying to suppress information about alien visitors. They are usually described as wearing dark suits. The term was coined by author Jonh Keane in the 60s, although at that point they had already been part of UFO lore for a couple of decades. Sometimes they are said to have a bizarre appearance or exhibit strange behavior, leading to suspicions that they are actually aliens posing as government agents or that the government has been compromised by alien invaders.
