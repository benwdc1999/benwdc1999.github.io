  Initialism for Unidentified Flying Object. Coined by the US Air Force in 1953, while technically referring to any unknown aerial phenomena, the term is closely associated with the extraterrestrial hypothesis, with the UFOs popularly believed to be alien spacecraft. While the word is of a more recent vintage, the concept is far older. Visions in the air that defy conventional explanation exist through all of recorded history. Alien craft offered as explanation for strange lights seen in the night sky goes back to the 19th century if not earlier. Literature featuring visitors from other planets traveling to earth in space-going vessels long predate the Christian era.
