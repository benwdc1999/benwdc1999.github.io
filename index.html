    <h1>Welcome to my web log.</h1>

<h2>First Entry</h2>

<p>
I'm not really satisfied with the way social media turned out. In the days of MySpace and Friendster it seemed so promising.
In the days of Twitter and Facebook it seems very broken. While I do have some issues with the way these sites are set up, maybe the sites themselves are not the main problem.
Maybe the problem is that everyone is on it. When every celebrity and corporate brand has a twitter page, that does change the dynamic.
Either way, I'm not exactly sure what the solution is. Maybe it's to create a better alternative.

<h2>Second Entry</h2>
<p>
  I remember when the closest thing to social media that I encountered was Usenent and the message boards and comment sections of various sites.
  The social aspect of the internet was widely distributed, and I tend to think that was a better system.
  I do wonder if having a handful of sites where most users congregate makes it easier for malicious actors to use those sites as the hubs of disinformation campaigns.
  I also have doubts that it's possible to go back to the old state of affairs. Social media is probaby not going away.
