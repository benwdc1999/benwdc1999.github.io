    Alien in modern UFO mythology, frequently featured in stories of alien abductions. The details vary, but they are usually described as human-like, but with grey skin, large solid black eyes, slits in place of noses, and hairless bodies. They
    first start to appear in accounts of alien encounters beginning in the 1940s, but they show up in popular science fiction long before that, with similar creatures described in the novels of H.G. Wells and other authors of the genre. The abduction
    account of Betty and Barney Hill in the 1960s featured aliens that resembled Greys, although a bit different than the standard version. Aliens that bore a resemblance appear in the Steven Spielburg movies Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and
    E.T.

    When author Whitley Streiber published Communion, featuring his own account of alien abduction and featuring a classic Grey Alien on the cover, reports of alien abduction by Grays substantially increased. In the 90s they had become a science
    fiction staple, appearing frequently in television shows and video games.
