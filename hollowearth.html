      In many ancient religions, the realm of the dead was said to lie beneath the earth’s surface. In the early modern era this gave way to non-religious speculation that there were vast expanses deep in the earth that could be traversed and that support large populations, even long-lived subterranean civilizations. This theme is explored in Jules Verne’s Journey To The Center Of The Earth, where surface explorers encounter dinosaurs and primitive humans. While Verne’s version is perhaps the most famous, the concept was visited in a number of other science fiction works, including Casanova’s proto-scifi novel icosameron. In the 2oth century, some UFO aficionados theorized that the mysterious craft did not have extraterrestrial origins at all, but rather originated from advanced civilizations that resided beneath the surface. One popular version of this was author Richard Shaver’s account of the subterranian Deros (deranged robots) and their angelic counterparts the Terros. After Shaver published his story, many people reported their own encounters with these creatures, which often resembled the alien abductions of later years.
