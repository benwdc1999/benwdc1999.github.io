  <h1>Recovered Memory</h1>
<hr>
</div>

<p> A controversial concept in psychology. The belief that memories can be repressed and inacessible to the conscious mind, but that a therapis can allow the patient access to these memories, often through hypnotism.
A particularyly controversial subset of this already controversial concept is the use of recovered memory therapy in cases involving alien abductions. In these instances it was believed that the aliens could lock the memory away, but a hypnotist could recover the memory.
Often this would lead to accusations that the hypnotist was leading the subject and encouraging the invention of false memories.
