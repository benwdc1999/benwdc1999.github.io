<p>A city in New Mexico. The site of an alleged incident where the US Army Air Force recovered the debris of a crashed extraterrestrial craft. While the US Army stated that the debris it recovered was a weather balloon, an earlier press release, perhaps poorly worded, led to the belief that it was something else and that the US government was trying to conceal this information. The incident has long been a fixture of UFO mythology in the US. </p>
